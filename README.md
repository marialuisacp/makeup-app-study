iOS native app study by @marialuisacp

This code is a study of iOS native applications. I'd used this technologies to build this app:

 - Xcode 12
 - Swift 5
 - SwiftUI
 - Unit tests

The project consumes a public API called [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) wich provides to many endpoints with makeup information, for example, a list of products of too many brands and categories.
