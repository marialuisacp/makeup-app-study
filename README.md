## About project
This code is a study of iOS native applications. I'd used this technologies to build this app:

 - Xcode 12

 - Unit tests

The only purpouse of this project is study and learning more about iOS development and Swift code. 

## API

The project consumes a public API called [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) wich provides too many endpoints, containing for example, a list of makeup products of too many brands and categories.
